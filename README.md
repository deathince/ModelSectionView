# Project - Section view of a 3d model.

created by Tianxiang Chu for study purpose.

# Introduction

this package is designed to help generate simple 3d model with very
basic shape. the model is stored as 2 matrix of points and connections.
Also, package can generate a graph of models' section view in given plane.

# installation instruction.

the project will be posted on github, using devtools to install from github
using following line

devtools::install_github("deathince/ModelSectionView")

# the on going work

I have create most the functions' skeletons. Many of them are designed
to generate some model as user's favor. I need to wrap up the unfinished 
functions and maybe transfer some code to C++ for better looping
Also, I did not write function that generate section view yet. I should 
have it updated in the later work.
